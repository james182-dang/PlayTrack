Currently PlayTrack is functional. You can sign up and keep track of your completed games as well as make posts and leave reviews. The next planned features to implement are:

- Functional Likes
- Widget sidebar completion
- Redesign of various elements (mostly textboxes including the post box and review post box)

Future implementations include (but are not limited to)
- Profile leveling
- PSN/Xbox Live/Steam connectivity for real-time updating.

This is an ongoing project and, while it is functional, it is frequently being updated. If you have
feature ideas or anything you would like to add, feel free to contact me and I'll see what I can do!
